# NHTSA Vehicle API Reader (proj-nhtsa-vehicle-api)
The intent of this project is to allow an easy and clean way to access (and cache) data from the National [Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Vehicle API](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/).

Most of my inital focus was on reading information about Makes, Models, and information about Manufacturer's; but, I anticipate needing to expand into supporting other features like decoding VIN's.
